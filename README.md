This repository demonstrates an intermittent bug encountered during the `expo prebuild` step in an Expo managed workflow project.  The bug manifests as unpredictable build failures with inconsistent error messages.  The `bug.js` file contains a simplified representation of the project structure that exhibits the issue.  The `bugSolution.js` file shows potential solutions to mitigate or resolve the problem.  This issue is particularly frustrating because of its random nature and the lack of consistent error reporting.  Solutions explored include cleaning the project cache, ensuring all dependencies are up-to-date, and verifying the correctness of the app.json file.
